# PocketCoach â€” Full Hackathon Scaffold (v2)

This is an enhanced scaffold for the PocketCoach project (Interactive Financial Life Coach for Teens).
It includes frontend and backend with mock auth, charts, gamification, quizzes, leaderboard, parent features,
and a friendly rule-based "AI" chatbot for offline demos.

## How to run (local demo)

1. Install dependencies for frontend and backend.
   - Frontend uses Parcel for quick demo and Chart.js for charts.
2. Start backend (port 4000) and frontend (port 3000).

## Quick commands (from project root)
- Frontend:
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm start

- Backend:
  cd backend
  npm install
  node server.js

This scaffold is for demo and hackathon purposes. Replace mock auth with Firebase/Auth and integrate Dialogflow/Rasa for production NLU.
